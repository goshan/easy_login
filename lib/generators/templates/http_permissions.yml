# Declare a redirect schema for differenct user accessing differect controller and action here
#
# The basic format for this permission schema is like
# controller:
#   action:
#     user_role1: pass
#     user_role2: redirect_to->{path}
#     user_role3: raise->{message}
#
# The user_role if the role attribute of your user model configed in config/application.rb or config/environments/*.rb
#
# The action has 3 types
#   pass --> run the logic in action normally
#   redirect_to --> redirect to other {path}, {path} also has two types, {xxx_path} means using rails routing method, and {other format} means used as absolute url string
#   raise --> raise a 404 response with {message}
#
# If the schema was not defined in controller/action/user_role, the schema in controller/default/user_role will be used.
# Also, if it was not defined in controller/default/user_role, default/user_role will be used.
# If still default/user_role could not be found, easylogin will do action same as 'pass'
#
#
